# Widget Testing Checklist

This document outlines steps to verify the Copilot widget works correctly.

1. After deploying the widget and snippet, perform a hard refresh.
2. Confirm the floating launcher appears bottom-right on all site pages.
3. Click the launcher; ensure the panel opens and closes.
4. Send test queries and verify responses follow Tonyâ€™s persona rules (concise, warm, personal).
5. Check on mobile: the panel should fit within the screen and not cover key content.
6. Verify no layout or content shifts in the page behind the widget.
