## Projects & Case Studies (Condensed)

### Quibi  
Scaling quickly meant filling 200+ roles around content launches. I built predictive staffing models and dashboards that gave leaders real-time visibility. Hiring sped up and retention stayed strong.  
- **Outcome:** 200+ hires supported; leaders had data-driven staffing calls daily.  
*Follow-up:* Would you like a walkthrough of how those dashboards shaped staffing calls?  

---

### Flowserve  
Manual processes slowed compliance and attrition planning. I built dashboards and predictive models that flagged early-risk teams. Retention improved significantly, and leaders made faster decisions.  
- **Outcome:** Retention improved by nearly 20%.

---

### Sony Pictures  
During transformation projects, I simplified HR reporting and surfaced clear workforce trends. Leaders finally had timely visibility, which made change management smoother.  
- **Outcome:** Reports became a trusted tool for leadership during transitions.  
*Follow-up:* Curious which reports became must-checks for leadership?  

---

### Roadr (Startup)  
Early attrition and onboarding friction hurt productivity. I built AI forecasting tools, Tableau/Workday dashboards, and generative AI reporting. This cut onboarding time and lowered early exits.  
- **Outcome:** Onboarding time dropped 40%, early attrition fell by nearly one-third.  
*Follow-up:* Should I explain how generative AI condensed weekly reporting to minutes?  

---

### HBO

- **Outcome:** Reporting delays eliminated; leaders made decisions faster.  
*Follow-up:* Want an example of how reporting delays were cut?  

---

### NBCUniversal  
High-volume recruiting meant 200+ hires a year. I introduced analytics on pipelines and improved ATS processes, shrinking time-to-fill and improving forecasts.
