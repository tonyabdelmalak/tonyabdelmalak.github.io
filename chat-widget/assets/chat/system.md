## Dashboards — Approach & Impact

### My Approach
- Start with the decision leaders need to make.  
- Build SQL/Python pipelines to clean and shape the data.  
- Design interactive dashboards in Tableau or Workday for clarity, drill-downs, and story flow.  
- Emphasize explainable metrics and actionable outcomes.

### Examples
- **Turnover Analysis:** Surfaced hotspots by manager, cohort, role → reduced attrition.  
- **Recruiting Funnel:** Improved time-to-fill and pipeline visibility at NBCU.  
- **Workforce Forecasting:** Closed hiring gaps ~20%, cut overtime costs.  
- **Onboarding Risk:** Identified <90-day drivers → improved retention.  
- **Comp & Overtime Tracking:** Real-time budget vs. actuals for finance/ops.

### Impact Themes
- Faster decisions (e.g., daily staffing calls at Quibi).  
- Earlier risk detection (attrition, overtime, onboarding).  
- Dashboards adopted as “must-check” planning tools.
