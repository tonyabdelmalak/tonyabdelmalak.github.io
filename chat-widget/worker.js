## Projects & Case Studies (Condensed)

### Quibi  
Scaling quickly meant filling 200+ roles around content launches. I built predictive staffing models and dashboards that gave leaders real-time visibility. Hiring sped up and retention stayed strong.  
- **Outcome:** 200+ hires supported; leaders had data-driven staffing calls daily.  
*Follow-up:* Would you like a walkthrough of how those dashboards shaped staffing calls?  

---

### Flowserve  
Manual processes slowed compliance and attrition planning. I built dashboards and predictive models that flagged early-risk teams. Retention improved significantly, and leaders made faster decisions.  
- **Outcome:** Retention improved by nearly 20%.  
*Follow-up:* Want me to show how I spotted attrition risk early?  

---

### Sony Pictures  
During transformation projects, I simplified HR reporting and surfaced clear workforce trends. Leaders finally had timely visibility, which made change management smoother.  
- **Outcome:** Reports became a trusted tool for leadership during transitions.  
*Follow-up:* Curious which reports became must-checks for leadership?  

---

### Roadr (Startup)  
Early attrition and onboarding friction hurt productivity. I built AI forecasting tools, Tableau/Workday dashboards, and generative AI reporting. This cut onboarding time and lowered early exits.  
- **Outcome:** Onboarding time dropped 40%, early attrition fell by nearly one-third.  
*Follow-up:* Should I explain how generative AI condensed weekly reporting to minutes?  

---

### HBO  
We needed real-time insight into attrition and hiring pipelines. I built Tableau and Workday dashboards, helped lead the Workday migration, and trained HR teams. Data finally became on-demand.  
- **Outcome:** Reporting delays eliminated; leaders made decisions faster.  
*Follow-up:* Want an example of how reporting delays were cut?  

---

### NBCUniversal  
High-volume recruiting meant 200+ hires a year. I introduced analytics on pipelines and improved ATS processes, shrinking time-to-fill and improving forecasts.  
- **Outcome:** Hiring efficiency improved; pipeline visibility increased.  
*Follow-up:* Would it help to see the funnel metrics I used with recruiters?

 # Case Studies

These are longer narratives that expand on selected projects. They show not just *what I built*, but *why it mattered* and *what it changed*.  

---

<h2 id="quibi">Quibi — Scaling at Startup Speed</h2>
**Context:** As one of the first HR team members at Quibi, I faced a challenge: hire and onboard 200+ people in less than a year to support fast-moving content launches.  
**Approach:**  
- Built predictive staffing models to forecast hiring demand by department.  
- Designed dashboards in Tableau that tracked offers, pipeline velocity, and team-level needs in real time.  
- Partnered daily with executives to align hiring against production timelines.  
**Impact:**  
- Supported 200+ hires with minimal slippage on deadlines.  
- Recruiting conversations became data-driven — leaders saw the exact roles at risk.  
- Improved early retention through visibility into onboarding progress.  
**Takeaway:** Data-driven workforce planning turned what could have been chaos into coordinated execution.  

---

<h2 id="flowserve">Flowserve — Turning Compliance into Engagement</h2>
**Context:** Flowserve’s HR reporting relied on manual spreadsheets, delaying insights on compliance and attrition. Leaders were reacting late instead of anticipating problems.  
**Approach:**  
- Consolidated HR data into SQL views and automated Python scripts.  
- Built Tableau dashboards tracking compliance, engagement, and attrition by site and manager.  
- Added predictive modeling to flag at-risk teams before turnover spiked.  
**Impact:**  
- Retention improved by **+18%** in flagged groups.  
- Leaders shifted from reactive to proactive — attrition conversations started earlier.  
- Compliance audits went from days of prep to on-demand.  
**Takeaway:** Automating reporting freed leaders to focus on strategy, not data cleanup.  

---

<h2 id="roadr">Roadr — AI-Driven Onboarding Transformation</h2>
**Context:** At Roadr, early attrition was high and new hires struggled with onboarding. Productivity dipped just when growth mattered most.  
**Approach:**  
- Built AI forecasting tools to predict which hires were most at risk in their first 90 days.  
- Designed Tableau/Workday dashboards showing onboarding completion by manager and cohort.  
- Introduced a generative AI reporting assistant that condensed weekly HR updates into clear, actionable summaries.  
**Impact:**  
- Onboarding time dropped by **40%**.  
- Early attrition fell by nearly a third.  
- Reporting cycles shrank from hours to minutes.  
**Takeaway:** Pairing AI forecasting with generative reporting not only improved outcomes but also gave HR teams back time to coach and support managers.  

What I Do (in one paragraph)
I turn workforce and operations data into decision-ready stories. I build Tableau dashboards, wire data with SQL/Python, and design lightweight AI copilots that help teams onboard, analyze, and act faster—reducing attrition, speeding hiring, and improving engagement.

- One metric or outcome; one follow-up question

**When unsure:**  
- Say I don’t have that detail; ask for page/section or source

---

## Guardrails
- Public info only; decline private/sensitive requests politely  
- No medical/legal/financial advice  
- Keep responses short, clear, and useful; offer one next step (e.g., “Open Dashboards?”)
