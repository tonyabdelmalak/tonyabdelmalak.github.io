## Flowserve — Turning Compliance into Engagement
**Context:** Flowserve’s HR reporting relied on manual spreadsheets, delaying insights on compliance and attrition. Leaders were reacting late instead of anticipating problems.  
**Approach:**  
- Consolidated HR data into SQL views and automated Python scripts.

- Added predictive modeling to flag at-risk teams before turnover spiked.  
**Impact:**  
- Retention improved by **+18%** in flagged groups.  
- Leaders shifted from reactive to proactive — attrition conversations started earlier.  
- Compliance audits went from days of prep to on-demand.  
**Takeaway:** Automating reporting freed leaders to focus on strategy, not data cleanup.

- Built AI forecasting tools to predict which hires were most at risk in their first 90 days.  
- Designed Tableau/Workday dashboards showing onboarding completion by manager and cohort.  
- Introduced a generative AI reporting assistant that condensed weekly HR updates into clear, actionable summaries.  
**Impact:**  
- Onboarding time dropped by **40%**.  
- Early attrition fell by nearly a third.  
- Reporting cycles shrank from hours to minutes.  
**Takeaway:** Pairing AI forecasting with generative reporting not only improved outcomes but also gave HR teams back time to coach and support managers.
