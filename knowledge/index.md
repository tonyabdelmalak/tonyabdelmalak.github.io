## What I Do (in one paragraph)
I turn workforce and operations data into decision-ready stories. I build Tableau dashboards, wire data with SQL/Python, and design lightweight AI copilots that help teams onboard, analyze, and act faster—reducing attrition, speeding hiring, and improving engagement.

## Highlights at a Glance
- **Workforce Planning Model:** Forecasts hiring vs. budget & role demand → ~20% fewer hiring gaps; moderated overtime.  
- **Turnover Analysis Dashboard:** Monitors voluntary/involuntary turnover & early exits; leaders acted on hotspots.  
- **Early Turnover Segmentation:** Exposes <90-day onboarding gaps; targeted fixes lowered early exits.  
- **Attrition Risk Prototype:** Explainable risk ranking (no protected attributes).

## How I Work
Start from the decision needed → sketch the story → wire data (SQL/Python) → build in Tableau. Keep models explainable, metrics meaningful, and outputs actionable.
